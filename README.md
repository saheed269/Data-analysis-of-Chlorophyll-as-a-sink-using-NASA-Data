# Data-analysis-of-Chlorophyll-as-a-sink-using-NASA-Data

Chlorophyll is the main souce of carbon sink. From 2015 to 2020, day by day chlorophyll level is decreasing. We want to show the world that chlorophyll level is drowning & for this capacity of worldâ€™s carbon sinking level is decreasing. 
We have taken input from from NASA WORLDVIEW. We have added Aqua/MODIS, Terra/MODIS, Soumi NPP/VIIRS layer to see chlorophyll data.

 

Then we analyzed it via MATLAB. We have separated images into 5 layers & then calculated the changes of layers over the years.
 We have analyzed  data of chlorophyll from August 2015 to September 2020.  Here Red level means here chlorophyll level is lowest & green level means in that region chlorophyll level is the highest. The figure showing that green level area is decreasing & red level area is increasing. This is actually plot of covered area of any zone vs year. Here we start from 2015 & each 1 in x axis indicates 6 months.
